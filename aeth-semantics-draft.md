Limnal aeth semantics are based on quite early version of Traumae, but are different enough, which is reflected in the choice of their names.

For some of keys, changing aeth vector reverses the relative meaning of aeth; `A kini B` = `B koni A`. *Maybe it should be a general pattern.*

**Traverse** key describes a sort of abstract spatial relation, not unlike subset one, but more general one: A contains/envelops/provides context for B. Neutral vector meaning is not yet determined.

**Direction** key descrives a generalized causation: A influences B. Neutral vector means something like synchronicity or identity between A and B.

**Modality** key interpreted similar to Neauismetica narrative. ***Certain*** are events instantiated in immediately accessible reality. ***Possible*** are more abstract events not currently available, and ***Impossible*** ones are those that can exist only as representations.

**Nature** key describes hierarchy of organization and consciousness. ***Minimal*** are entities without subjectivity, ***Person***s are self-aware ones, and ***Emergent*** have higher-order awareness. Mantycore is not fully satisfied with this approach - it resemble **Traverse** key too much. Maybe decouple the idea of subjectivity from hierarchy.

**Counter** is a sort of zero-one-infinity scale, but also serve to provide discrete vs. continupus contrast.
